So, i had a session trying out the new Ionic support for Meteor! My expectations were high and the experience was pleasant. I ended up doing a small <a href="http://angular-meteor.com/">angular-meteor</a> application, scraping some information of my companies list of employees, neatly wrapping it in <a href="http://ionicframework.com/">Ionic framework</a>. You can read the full blog post <a href="http://blog.squeed.com/2015/10/trying-out-meteor-ionic/">here </a> if interested! The source code for the application can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/arenhage/squeeders_meteor_ionic_sample">git-repo</a>!
