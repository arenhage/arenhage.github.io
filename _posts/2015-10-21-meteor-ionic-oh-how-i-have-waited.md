With the new official Angular support in meteor 1.2, a lot of new and exciting stuff is starting to emerge in the meteor eco-system. The most recent being the newly official support with the hybrid mobile application framework <a href="http://ionicframework.com/">Ionic</a>. This is something that i have been waiting for since i first started using Meteor. The necessity of being able to create nice and neat mobile applications without being a css god is something that i have missed out in the meteor family up until now. Having used ionic prior to meteor im exited to try out if it will run as smoothly as it does native Ionic with the reactive power from Meteor. Exciting stuff!
